# Malware Detection using Deep Learning techniques 

This project is a study about to understand better techniques that can be apply to some particular kind of dataset as .exe and .dll files.

## Technology

* Keras/TensorFlow
* Python/Jupyter Notebook
* Google Colab

## Implementation overview

### First try

In my first try to resolve this problem I used RNN/LSTM, because my Dataset is a bit's sequence and LSTM deal well with this kind of data.<br /> 
`Results:` Because my Dataset was too large(200k x 52k) I could not use all in Google Colab for training. Using just 10 sample I got a loss near to 70%
